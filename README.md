#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software systems.  It applies engineering principles to software development to ensure that applications are reliable, scalable, maintainable, and efficient.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

i) The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 - NATO Conference)
ii) The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s - 1980s)
iii) The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2001 - Present)


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) Requirement Analysis - This phase involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting software requirements from stakeholders.
ii) Planning - This stage focuses on project feasibility, cost estimation, resource allocation, and timeline definition.
iii) Design - The system architecture and software design are created based on the requirements.
iv) Implementation (Coding) - Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications.
v) Testing - The software is tested for bugs, security issues, and functionality alignment with requirements.
vi) Deployment - The software is released to the production environment for users.
vii) Maintenance & Support - After deployment, software requires updates, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile are two widely used software development methodologies, each with distinct approaches, advantages, and limitations. The Waterfall methodology follows a sequential, linear process where each phase (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next. In contrast, the Agile methodology is iterative and incremental, allowing for continuous feedback, adaptation, and delivery of working software in small cycles called sprints.

One of the key differences between the two methodologies is flexibility. Waterfall is rigid, making it difficult to accommodate changes once development begins. Agile, on the other hand, is highly flexible, enabling teams to modify requirements and features based on ongoing feedback from stakeholders. This makes Agile particularly useful in projects where requirements evolve over time.

Another important distinction lies in customer involvement. In the Waterfall approach, customers are primarily involved at the beginning during the requirements phase and at the end when the product is delivered. This can lead to misalignment between expectations and the final product. In contrast, Agile involves customers throughout the development cycle, ensuring that feedback is continuously integrated, reducing the risk of building a product that does not meet user needs.

Testing also differs significantly between the two methodologies. In Waterfall, testing occurs only after development is completed, which increases the risk of discovering critical issues late in the process. Agile integrates continuous testing, identifying and fixing defects early, which improves software quality and reduces overall project risk.

In terms of documentation, Waterfall relies heavily on comprehensive documentation before development begins, ensuring a clear roadmap but potentially leading to delays. Agile focuses more on working software over extensive documentation, emphasizing adaptability and speed. This makes Agile more suitable for dynamic environments where quick changes are necessary.
